Incorrect logic for computing X(i), incorrect logic for computing X(i+1)-X(i), incorrect termination logic.
Incorrect variable declaration, logic for computing X(i) correct, termination condition for while loop is incorrect.
Used %d for scanning double, incorrect logic for computing X(i) and X(i+1), incorrect logic for terminating while loop.

& operator missing in scanning of variable. Completely incorrect logic.

not printing any statement in while loop, no condition and semicolons in while loop,X(i+1)-X(i) part not computed.
