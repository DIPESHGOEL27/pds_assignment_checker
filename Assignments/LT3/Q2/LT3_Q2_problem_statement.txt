Consider that you are given two univariate polynomials as string inputs. Your task is to multiply the two polynomials using the following method. First, declare a structure to store a polynomial. The elements of the structure should contain the following items: number of terms, coefficient, and exponent. Now from the given string input, extract the coefficients and exponents of each term of a polynomial, and store accordingly in the structure. For example, if a given polynomial is of the form "3x^5+2x^4+5x^2+2x+7", then there are 5 terms with coefficients 3, 2, 5, 2, 7 respectively. The exponents are 5, 4, 2, 1, 0 respectively. For the two polynomials, you need to define an array of two structures to store them. Finally, perform the multiplication from the structure representation, and return the resultant polynomial as a string.

Ex:
Enter the first polynomial as string: 3x^2-x+10
Enter the second polynomial as string: x+2

The resultant polynomial after multiplication in the form of string is: 3x^3+5x^2+8x+20
