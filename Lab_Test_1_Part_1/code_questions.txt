1;Reading in the coordinates in X and Y arrays
1;Printing the points (in a single line)
1;Two nested loops to compare the points
1;Non-dictated point Condition check
1;Keeping track of non-dictated and printing
1;Finding each non-dictated point
2;Deleting and rearranging the array (Must delete from X and Y), Deleting means if there are K such points remaining, they should be in the first K positions in X and Y, and the number of elements n should be changed to K (or you can keep a separate count and use that to print, that is ok too). So you have to shift the array after each deletion and adjust the number of entries.
