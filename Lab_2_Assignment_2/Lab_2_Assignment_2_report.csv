Khushiben  Vaghela,0,0,0,5,20,20,20,65,"Program failed for Test 1: Complex roots (should just print a message) - Mark/s lost: 10
Program failed for Test 2: Real roots, unequal (should print both roots) - Mark/s lost: 10
Program failed for Test 3: Real roots, equal (should also print the message) - Mark/s lost: 10
Failed Criteria: Reading in a, b, c with proper format string - Mark/s lost: 5
Dont use getch() in C, the program is correct but didnt give correct output due to using %d in scanf for float (use %f)"

Nishita Singh,10,10,10,10,20,20,20,100,Dont put extra spaces in scanf() the program may not work sometimes

Use float/double for such problems because coefficients can be floating numbers as well, also you forgot to print the root when its equal"

Always try to compile the file to check for errors, good that you've covered many cases that dont need computation"
